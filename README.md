This arcade video game, Gonki, means racing in Russian; as the name states it is an endless arcade style racing game. Created in 2021 by Nick and Estelee, it showcases the basics of pygame and how simple it is for anyone to make a game! 
Some difficulties we had was moving the hit boxes (for collision) with the user's car. We overcame this by reviewing online websites that explained collision in their own similar pygame. Another difficulty was making the infinite track. To do this the game randomly selects one of the twenty tracks and stitches them together. We learned sprite groupings and how easy collision detection is, and just the overall basics of pygame. Watching our game slowly come to life despite all of the hurdles was the funnest part of the project. We had to rewrite the code a few times but that's what made the success of the video game working very gratifying.
Game Features:
- There is no end point, you play for a high score
- Your score is constantly increasing while on the track, and it's paused when on grass.
- Every new track your speed increases and you gain points faster.
- Hitting a rock ends the game, try playing again for a higher score!
